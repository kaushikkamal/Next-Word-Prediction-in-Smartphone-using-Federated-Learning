# Next Word Prediction in Smartphone using Federated Learning

A mobile application that can predict the suitable
word(s) followed by the user’s typed word (s). The algorithm uses the users’ text history to do the prediction operation.
It required knowledge from fields like deep learning, federated learning, recurrent neural network etc.

# Word prediction process

The process in which the deep learning model does the prediction operation in a real time device using the
mobile application is shown below:

    <img src="assets/how are mock.png"  height="500" />
</p>

# Restrict mode and theme switching feature

When restrict mode is enabled, the users history will not be saved that means no violation of privacy policies. User can change the theme of the app based on their liking.

    <img src="assets/how are restrict white mock.png"  height="500" />  
</p>

# Test on Assamese words

The model was also trained and tested with a regional language which is Assamese.

# Updating model

The mobile application automatically updates the model during the time period 2 am to 4 am. The screenshots while the update was going on and when the update was completed by
the application are given below:

# Settings page

The mobile application consists of a settings page where the users can manage the partial appearance of the application according to their respective preferences. The features included in the settings page are as follows:

<br>
<br>

<p float="left"> 
    <img src="assets/settings 1 mock.png"  height="500" />
    <img src="assets/settings 2 mock.png"  height="500" />
</p>

<br>
<br>

-   **Change the count of the predicted words:**  
     According to the individual needs, different users can keep different predicted word count from 2 to 10.

-   **Change the radius of border outlines:**  
     Different users can use different shapes of the borders according to their taste.

-   **Change the theme:**  
     According to the preferences of the users, they have the provision of using different themes.
